# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Smart File Cleaning and Directory Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop logic to clean up unnecessary files post-extraction, preserving only final content and optimizing directory structure.
# Details:
Design algorithms to detect and remove redundant compressed files once extraction is complete, using pattern matching to identify split archives (e.g., 0~10, 0~35). Use Python's os and pathlib libraries for file system operations. Integrate this functionality into the extraction workflow so that after extraction, the temporary files are deleted, and the directory structure is organized for user access.

# Test Strategy:
Set up test cases with known file structures and check that only final files remain. Write integration tests to simulate the extraction followed by cleanup. Use mock file systems (pyfakefs) where applicable.
