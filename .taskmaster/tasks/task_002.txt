# Task ID: 2
# Title: Establish FastAPI Basic Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core FastAPI application structure including routers, middleware, and base endpoints required for rapidgator functionalities.
# Details:
Set up main.py to create a FastAPI instance. Organize routers for API endpoints. Implement basic middleware for logging and error handling. Use routing for health-check and base endpoints. Use Pydantic models for request/response schemas and include Jinja2 for template rendering. Ensure compatibility with Python 3.13.3.

# Test Strategy:
Run the FastAPI server with uvicorn, test endpoints (e.g., /health) using curl or Postman and verify response codes. Write unit tests for middleware functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create the main FastAPI application [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the FastAPI application and configure essential settings. [Updated: 2025. 7. 8.] [Updated: 2025. 7. 8.]
### Details:
Set up the main application file (e.g., `main.py`) to create an instance of FastAPI, configure middleware, and include routers.
<info added on 2025-07-08T06:31:16.750Z>
Refactor main.py to enhance structure: integrate CORS middleware, implement centralized exception handling, organize API routers more effectively, and configure detailed logging for improved traceability and debugging.

<info added on 2025-07-08T06:33:10.353Z>
Begin enhancements on the main FastAPI application by refactoring main.py into a more structured and modular format. Incorporate CORS support, centralized exception handling, reorganized API routers, and advanced logging configuration to improve traceability and maintainability.

Completed enhancements to the main FastAPI application, which now includes environment-specific CORS middleware, an advanced Loguru logging system for both colorful console output and production file logging, and robust exception handlers for HTTP and general errors with detailed responses. The application has been restructured using the app factory pattern via a create_app() function, enabling automatic logging of all HTTP requests and responses and lifecycle event hooks that manage directory creation and logging during server startup and shutdown. In addition, the enhanced health-check endpoint now verifies download path accessibility, and template states are centrally stored in app.state.templates for use in routers. Updated dependencies include python-jose[cryptography] (v3.5.0) for JWT/encryption support and loguru (v0.7.3) for advanced logging. Testing has confirmed successful FastAPI app import, correct configuration loading (Debug: True, Port: 8000), and fully functional logging.

## 2. Set up API routers [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Organize the application's endpoints using FastAPI's APIRouter.
### Details:
Create separate router modules for different resource groups (e.g., `users`, `items`) and include them in the main application.
<info added on 2025-07-08T06:40:28.835Z>
Initiate API router configuration according to the Super Rapidgator PRD. Create separate modules for the following routes: /auth (Rapidgator authentication management), /download (batch download management), /extract (archive extraction and cleanup), and / (main web UI). Each router should be placed in the src/super_rapidgator/api/ directory and registered in main.py.

API routers have been configured and integrated into the main application. The implementation includes the following router modules:

1. auth.py for Rapidgator authentication management (accessed via /api/auth) with endpoints for session status, login, logout, session refresh, and health checks.
2. download.py for batch download management (accessed via /api/download) with endpoints to start downloads, list batches, view batch details, cancel batches, check the download queue, and perform health checks.
3. extract.py for archive extraction and cleanup (accessed via /api/extract) offering endpoints to start extraction tasks, list jobs, view job details, cancel jobs, scan directories, check extraction queues, and perform health checks.
4. ui.py for the web UI (accessed via /) with endpoints for the main dashboard, download and extraction management pages, authentication page, download form submission, a custom API documentation page, system status, and UI-specific health checks.

A total of 27 endpoints have been created, incorporating Pydantic model validation, asynchronous background task handling, status-based task management, UUID-based identifiers, and temporary in-memory storage with plans for future database integration. All routers have been successfully registered in main.py and have passed initial testing for endpoint registration and FastAPI app integration.

## 3. Implement middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns such as CORS, authentication, and logging.
### Details:
Configure middleware components in the main application to manage tasks like CORS handling, request/response logging, and authentication.

## 4. Define base endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Establish foundational API endpoints for the application.
### Details:
Implement basic endpoints in the routers to handle CRUD operations for primary resources.

## 5. Integrate Pydantic models [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Define data models using Pydantic for request validation and response serialization.
### Details:
Create Pydantic models to validate incoming request data and serialize outgoing responses, ensuring data integrity and automatic documentation generation.
