# Task ID: 6
# Title: Integrate Background Task Queue
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up asynchronous background processing for download tasks using Celery along with asyncio support to handle concurrent downloads.
# Details:
Configure Celery (v5.3.0) with a broker like Redis. Create Celery tasks to handle the actual file downloading asynchronously. Ensure FastAPI endpoints trigger Celery tasks and track their state. Alternatively, use FastAPI's BackgroundTasks for simpler cases, but prioritize Celery given potential scalability demands.

# Test Strategy:
Run Celery workers and simulate multiple download tasks. Use unit tests to ensure tasks are enqueued and processed correctly. Monitor logs for simultaneous downloads and response time accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Celery with Redis as the Message Broker [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Celery to use Redis for managing task queues and results.
### Details:
Install Redis and Celery, then configure Celery to use Redis as both the broker and backend.

## 2. Develop Celery Tasks for Parallel URL Downloads [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create Celery tasks that handle downloading files from specified URLs concurrently.
### Details:
Implement tasks that accept a URL, download the content, and store it appropriately, ensuring they can run in parallel.

## 3. Integrate Celery Tasks with FastAPI Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Expose FastAPI endpoints to trigger the download tasks and retrieve their statuses.
### Details:
Create endpoints that allow users to submit URLs for download and check the progress or result of these tasks.

## 4. Implement Real-Time Task State Tracking [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Set up mechanisms to monitor and report the status of each download task in real-time.
### Details:
Utilize Celery's result backend to track task states and provide endpoints or interfaces for users to view task progress and outcomes.

## 5. Optimize for Scalability and Performance on Ubuntu Server [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent downloads efficiently on an Ubuntu server.
### Details:
Configure Celery workers, adjust concurrency settings, and optimize network and I/O operations to achieve maximum download speeds and system responsiveness.
