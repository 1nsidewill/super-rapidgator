# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Rapidgator Session Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the login and session management features for Rapidgator including automatic login, session persistence, auto re-login on expiry, and manual override.
# Details:
Implement a Rapidgator client in Python using httpx (v0.24.0) for asynchronous HTTP requests. Encapsulate login logic in a class that stores session cookies. Detect session expiry and trigger auto re-login. Provide an API endpoint (/api/rapidgator/login) and fallback using Selenium or Playwright if scraping is required. Use environment variables for credentials.

# Test Strategy:
Mock Rapidgator API responses to simulate login and session expiry. Write unit tests to validate that session cookies are managed correctly. Test manual login endpoint via API calls.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Playwright Browser Instance Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and manage Playwright browser instances to facilitate headless browser automation for Rapidgator login session management.
### Details:
This involves setting up Playwright in the project, configuring browser contexts, and ensuring proper resource management for efficient automation.

## 2. Automate Login Form Submission with CSRF Token Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop automation scripts to interact with Rapidgator's login form, including handling CSRF tokens to ensure secure authentication.
### Details:
Utilize Playwright to navigate to the login page, fill in credentials, manage CSRF tokens, and submit the form programmatically.

## 3. Implement Session Cookie Storage and Management [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create mechanisms to store and manage session cookies post-login to maintain authenticated sessions across browser instances.
### Details:
After successful login, extract session cookies and implement storage solutions to persist these cookies for future use.

## 4. Develop Session Validity Verification and Auto Re-login Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement functionality to verify the validity of the current session and automatically re-authenticate if the session has expired.
### Details:
Regularly check session status by accessing protected resources; if access is denied due to session expiry, trigger the login automation to re-establish a valid session.

## 5. Integrate with API Endpoint and Provide Manual Override Options [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Connect the automated login and session management system with the relevant API endpoints and offer manual override capabilities for user intervention.
### Details:
Ensure seamless integration with Rapidgator's API for data retrieval or submission, and implement features that allow users to manually override automated processes when necessary.

Real-world tests confirm that premium downloads now function flawlessly with full integration into the Super Rapidgator system. The process correctly handles 302 redirects to connect to the actual download server, extracts the accurate download URL, manages ERR_ABORTED responses as successful completions, and retrieves the proper file name. This test completed with one successful item and no failures, verifying that the premium download workflow is fully operational.
