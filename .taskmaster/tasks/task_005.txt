# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Batch Download API Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create API endpoints to accept multiple Rapidgator URLs for batch download, ensure request validation and provide a progress update mechanism.
# Details:
Implement POST endpoint at /api/download/start accepting a list of URLs. Validate input using Pydantic models. Integrate with Rapidgator client to initiate downloads. Update task status (pending, downloading, completed, failed) in the database or in-memory store. Use endpoints like /api/download/status/{task_id} to fetch progress.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests for API by sending POST requests with valid and invalid URL lists. Validate response structure and progress tracking. Use unit tests for Pydantic validations.
