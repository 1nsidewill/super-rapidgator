# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Python 3.13.3, create a virtual environment, set up package management (using uv) and basic directory structure according to the PRD.
# Details:
Create a Git repository. Set up a virtual environment with Python 3.13.3 using the uv package manager. Install essential packages such as fastapi (v0.95), uvicorn, and other dependencies using uv. Ensure the directory structure includes folders for incoming, processing, completed, and logs. Create a README and include environment variable templates. Use pre-commit hooks and linting (flake8).

# Test Strategy:
Validate the repository structure, run 'python --version' to verify the correct Python version, and use uv commands (such as 'uv list') to confirm dependency management, ensuring that basic scripts (like app.py) run without immediate errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None

## 2. Set Up Python 3.13.3 Virtual Environment Using uv [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Python 3.13.3 and create a virtual environment using the uv package manager.
### Details:
Use `uv python install 3.13.3` to install Python 3.13.3, then run `uv venv --python 3.13.3` to create a virtual environment.
<info added on 2025-07-08T05:26:15.136Z>
Python 3.13.3 virtual environment fully configured and activated. Verified uv 0.7.3 installation; ran "uv python install 3.13.3" to install Python, followed by "uv venv --python 3.13.3" to create the .venv directory. Activated the environment with "source .venv/bin/activate", confirmed the Python version is 3.13.3 and the prompt now displays (super-rapidgator) indicating a successful setup.

## 3. Install Essential Packages [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install necessary Python packages within the virtual environment.
### Details:
Activate the virtual environment and use `uv pip install <package_name>` to install required packages.
<info added on 2025-07-08T05:28:33.714Z>
Essential packages have been successfully installed. Additionally, the project was initialized using "uv init" to generate pyproject.toml, main.py, and README.md, and the .python-version file was removed to resolve pyenv conflicts. The installed packages include web server tools (fastapi 0.116.0, uvicorn 0.35.0, httpx 0.28.1, jinja2 3.1.6, python-multipart 0.0.20) and file handling utilities (aiofiles 24.1.0, patool 4.0.1, py7zr 1.0.0, rarfile 4.2), among others, with a total of 38 packages and all dependencies resolved.

## 4. Configure Project Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Organize the project files and directories according to best practices.
### Details:
Create directories such as `src`, `tests`, and `docs` to structure the project appropriately.
<info added on 2025-07-08T05:33:15.389Z>
Project structure updated as follows:
- Created src/super_rapidgator package with:
  • api for API routes
  • core for configuration and common functions including src/super_rapidgator/core/config.py for Pydantic settings
  • services for business logic
  • models for data models
  • utils for utility functions
- Added static directory for CSS and JS files, and templates directory for Jinja2 templates
- Established tests and docs directories
- Generated essential core files: .env as the environment variable template and main.py as the FastAPI app entrypoint
- Installed pydantic-settings (2.10.1)
- Validated setup by successfully running the FastAPI application and confirming proper loading of all configuration files.
