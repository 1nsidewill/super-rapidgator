# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement File Management and Storage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop file management logic to store downloaded files into the proper directories (/mnt/smb/downloads) according to the defined structure.
# Details:
Build a module to handle file operations such as moving downloads from a temporary folder to /mnt/smb/downloads/incoming. Ensure error checking for disk space and file overwrite issues. Use Pythonâ€™s os and shutil libraries with added logging. Consider streaming downloads for large files to manage memory consumption.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for file movement operations. Test on a simulated directory structure to ensure that files are stored in the correct paths without loss. Validate edge cases like disk full errors.
