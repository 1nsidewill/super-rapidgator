# Task ID: 3
# Title: Docker Compose and Traefik Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Docker Compose for containerization of the FastAPI application and set up Traefik as a reverse proxy.
# Details:
Create a Dockerfile based on Python 3.13.3. Write a docker-compose.yml that defines the app service, ports (8000:8000), and links to Traefik. Configure Traefik labels for routing (e.g., Host(`rapidgator.local`)). Ensure volumes are mounted for persistent storage (/mnt/smb/downloads) and logs. Validate that configuration supports VPN and firewall settings.

# Test Strategy:
Build and run containers locally. Use 'docker-compose up' to test accessibility over the defined port and domain name. Verify that Traefik routes traffic to the app properly.
