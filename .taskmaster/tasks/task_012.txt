# Task ID: 12
# Title: Enhance Logging, Monitoring, and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive logging and error handling for downloads, extraction, and UI processes along with notification of task completion.
# Details:
Integrate Pythonâ€™s logging module and consider using structured logging (e.g., loguru). Set up logging to write to /mnt/smb/downloads/logs. Implement error handling across the API endpoints, background tasks, and extraction engine. Optionally, integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for performance metrics. Ensure that user-friendly error messages are shown on the UI and create an alert system upon job completion or failure.

# Test Strategy:
Perform fault injection testing to simulate network errors, extraction failures, and file management issues. Validate logs for correct error messages and test monitoring endpoint responses. Execute end-to-end tests simulating task failure scenarios.
